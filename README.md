# The Input Game

Today, we're going to be working with booleans. Like... a lot.

### What our app will do
Look at five inputs from the user and give them a result. It will do so by _comparing_ the input they typed to a _range_ of possible answers.

### Some example apps:
* A combination lock. Check the five inputs against the secret set of numbers you have, and if they all match, give the user a **secret message**.
* A Presidential Primary battle. The user enters their five top candidates, and the app will compare them and tell you who of those candidates--in the app writer's opinion--is going to win.

Don't do those, though. Do something else!

### What tools will you use to do all that?
* You must use _each_ of the following non-looping, boolean-checking control flow tools:
	* if, if-else, and/or else-if
	* switch statements
	* ternary statements
* Global variables to track the state of your app--this way each of your functions can access data the others are changing
* A "Start Over" button that will empty every input and reset your variables.
* A "Switch" button that will change things over to use your _other app_.

That's right, attention-payers: once you've successfully finished  an app, **make another!**

### Where do I start?
* Get at least one app idea (and run it by your teacher!)
* See if you can get your app to console.log the contents of all five input fields.
* ???
* Profit!
